===IMPORTANT===
To create an item that will spawn using the item spawner you must do the following:
Add this to your item file: ITEM.value = "Rarity";
These are the rarities that can be used and must be contained within quotes:
Abundant
Common
Uncommon
Valuable
Rare
Legendary

==CHANCES==
Abundant - 100% chance of being included in the list to possibly spawn.
Common - 75%
Uncommon - 50%
Valuable - 25%
Rare - 10%
Legendary - 1%

=ALSO IMPORTANT=
To avoid infinite loops (aka stuff that results in a server crash), do one of the following:
1. Create many item spawns across your map.
2. Create an item spawn in an isolated and unreachable location.

=NOTES=
Item Spawner+ includes an item spawn ESP to be able to see item spawn locations. To enable, one must be a Super Admin and one can activate Item Spawn ESP via the Settings menu.
